#each node is a package of information 
#each package needs to be able to locate itself based on itslef and the one after 
#find enumerable...? probably not because it is based on and makes an array
#see/search for the data
#count how many times have done that

#google finding or setting a tail in a linked list ruby
#find_tail method...anytime call method it will recalculate the list
